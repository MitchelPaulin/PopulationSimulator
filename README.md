# PopulationSimulator
Population Simulator is a program meant to observe how populations can change over time. Every creature has a certain energy expenditure and three attributes; speed, size and sight. You can see how these attributes become more prominent or recessive over time as only surviving creatures pass on their attributes to their offspring. 

![sample](https://github.com/MitchelPaulin/PopulationSimulator/blob/master/assets/demo/sample.png)

The creatures compete for food using their attributes to try and beat out the other creatures in a limited resource pool. 

* Size  : Larger creatures can eat smaller ones 
* Speed : Faster creatures can reach food easier 
* Sight : Creatures can see food and other creatures further away
